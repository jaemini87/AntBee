About MLB
MLB, Major League Baseball, is the biggest professional baseball competition and was founded in 1869. MLB
betting odds can be found across OddsPortal.com
There are thirty teams competing in the MLB at present with twenty-nine from the USA and a solitary team from
Canada. Teams are divided into two leagues, the National League (16 teams) and the American League (14
teams). Each league has three subdivisions (East, Central and West).
MLB regular season and its MLB odds get underway on the first Sunday in April and ends in October followed by
the postseason. But before everything begins Spring training takes place. This is a series of practices and
exhibition games before the MLB regular season starts proper and lasts almost two months. All MLB teams
involved play 162 matches each year in the MLB regular season before it ends after the first Sunday in
October. Each match offers a wide range of MLB odds comparison.
Postseason play-offs follow where eight teams are involved. The first play-off round (American League Division
Series and National League Division Series) is best-of-five series followed by best-of-seven Championship Series
and best-of-seven World Series. You can also find best MLB odds on the series winners with OddsPortal.com
There is an All-Star Game played halfway through the season in early July where a team of players from the
MLB National League takes on a team of American League players.
The New York Yankees are the most successful Major League Baseball team and always are thought of as
favourite in the MLB betting odds comparison market.
